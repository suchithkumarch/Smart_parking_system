# Smart_parking_system
IoT course project,
by Biri Arya Vardhan Reddy - IMT2018017 & Chebrolu Suchith kumar - IMT2018019.

Created a Flutter based mobile application which can display whether a parking lot is vacant or occupied, and can also provide information like the number of vacancies in each floor. Raspberry Pi is used to regularly observe the ultrasonic sensor data and upload it to a cloud platform. The application pulls the readings from the cloud and processes them to decide occupancy.
